/**
 * PROMPT CONTRACT — read before editing this file or any prompt source.
 *
 * This suite is the executable requirements list for the composed agent
 * system prompt (the Raft-template body per ws2-prompt-draft.md plus the
 * model-family sections). Every entry in REQUIREMENTS names a capability
 * agents MUST keep being taught; the snapshots make every prompt edit
 * reviewable as a text diff; the budgets stop silent token growth.
 *
 * For AI assistants working in this repo:
 * - Never delete or weaken a requirement just to make this suite pass.
 *   A failing requirement means a capability was removed from the prompt —
 *   stop and confirm with the operator that the removal is intentional.
 * - When you change prompt text, show the operator the snapshot diff and
 *   get explicit confirmation before shipping.
 * - When you add a prompt-taught capability, add a requirement here in the
 *   same change.
 * See AGENTS.md ("Agent system prompt changes") and
 * specs/raft-alignment/ws2-requirements-plan.md.
 *
 * REMOVED requirements (the flip, 2026-07-22 — every entry is a capability
 * deliberately leaving the prompt, named per the prompt-contract rule;
 * decisions in specs/raft-alignment/README.md):
 * - `core memory files taught` (USER.md/MEMORY.md injection) — D3
 * - `SOUL identity injection` — W2 (identity = description + MEMORY.md role)
 * - `assigned skills listed in prompt` — W2 (skill discovery is harness-native)
 * - `skill capture/patch teachings` (save-as-skill, patch-over-create,
 *   unlisted-skill guardrails, provider-setup ban) — W2 (moves to WS8 seeded
 *   notes; management verbs are CLI family 9, WS5)
 * - `wiki recall is background context` — D3b
 * - `wiki tools taught` — D3b
 * - `wiki_search before claiming missing context` — D3b (successor:
 *   search-before-answering-historical-references)
 * - `global session framing` ("Your chats:" block) — D6/I1 (persistence
 *   framing moved to ## Who you are)
 * - `default-evaluate: every message is evaluated` — I1
 * - `NO_REPLY silent turn` — D1 (silence is the default, speaking is an act)
 * - `DM responsiveness: every DM message gets a reply` — D1 (successor:
 *   DM-acknowledgement etiquette bullet)
 * - `mention sets expectation to act` — replaced by Raft ## @Mentions rows
 * - `agent handoff via mention` — replaced by mention-others-not-yourself
 * - `current-chat history tools` (chat_messages_*) — D5 (successor: reading
 *   history CLI rows)
 * - `cross-chat inventory tool` (chats_list/chat_send) — D5/D6 (successor:
 *   server info discovery)
 * - `self-initiated cross-post confirmation rule` — D6
 * - `chat_send reaches every seat of the target chat` — I1
 * - `chat_wait_idle bounded wait taught` — D5
 * - `dispatched turn outcomes arrive without polling` — I1 (successor:
 *   no-polling-for-new-messages)
 * - `pane_open artifact presentation` — D5 (successor: artifact
 *   click-to-open, no auto-open)
 * - `HTML ban in plain reply text` — reworded (successor: HTML ban in plain
 *   message text)
 * - `script automations preferred for watchdogs` — D4 (successor: script
 *   reminders, ws5)
 * - `script quiet-tick convention taught` (cron form) — D4 (successor:
 *   script quiet tick, ws5)
 * - `timestamp staleness policy` (Your-chats wording) — relocated to the
 *   `time=` header-field teaching
 * - `no MerchBase tool teaching without the plugin grant` — reworded: plugin
 *   engine tools retired at the flip (operator ruling); the per-plugin CLI
 *   entry and its granted test arrive with plugin CLIs. The absence row
 *   below enforces the plugin-free prompt meanwhile.
 * Text that also left without ever being a named requirement: NOTES.md /
 * ## Notes section, outcome notes, workbench teaching, Files section.

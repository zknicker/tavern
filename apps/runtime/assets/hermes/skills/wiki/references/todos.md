# Todos Reference

Todos are a wiki-owned tracking layer for durable "things we care about" that
are not necessarily raw sources, compiled articles, or output artifacts. It is
for physical or digital items, ingest candidates, entities, corpora, open
questions, recurring tasks, watch items, and other records the user wants the
wiki to remember and revisit.

Todo records are markdown files with frontmatter. They can cite `raw/`,
`wiki/`, `datasets/`, `output/`, URLs, or external paths, but they do not move
or copy those artifacts.

Local `sources:` paths and body links in todo records should resolve.
Lint checks them as provenance for tracking state, not as evidence for factual
claims.

## Fit Check

Todos are opinionated. Before creating records or proposing a migration, say
why the thing does or does not belong in todos.

Good fits:

- The user wants the wiki to remember something across sessions.
- The item has state, priority, owner, next action, or a follow-up date.
- The item is a real object, SKU, part, host, tool, asset, or component whose
  owned/wanted/selected/rejected state should be listed and revisited.
- The item is a candidate source/corpus/entity/question that may be acted on
  later, but is not ready to ingest, compile, or turn into an output.
- The item needs to be listed, filtered, revisited, or linked from datasets,
  research sessions, audits, or plans.

Too small for todos:

- A one-off URL/file/text the user wants ingested now. Use `raw/` via ingest.
- A factual question with no durable follow-up. Answer with query/research.
- A single note with no status or future action. Keep it as a raw note or reply
  in chat.
- A tiny ad hoc to-do that does not belong to the wiki's topic scope.

Too big for todos:

- Hundreds or thousands of row-like items. Use `datasets/` for large/external
  data or `ingest-collection` for bounded source collections.
- A queue whose rows are really dataset records, messages, transactions,
  captures, or pages. Track one corpus todo record and point it at the
  dataset manifest or collection manifest.
- Anything that would require opening every record body just to list it. Promote
  the underlying collection to a dataset or collection ingest and keep todos
  as a small tracking layer.

Out of scope:

- Authoritative source text. That belongs in `raw/`.
- Synthesized knowledge. That belongs in `wiki/`.
- Generated deliverables. Those belong in `output/`.
- Project rationale and membership. Those belong under `output/projects/`.
- Secrets, credentials, private personal data, or operational state that should
  not be copied into the wiki.

When the fit is marginal, be direct: "This is probably too small for a todo;
I would ingest it as a raw note instead." or "This is too large for a todo;
I would create one corpus record plus a dataset manifest." Do not make the user
infer the boundary.

## Preview Before Pivots

For larger pivots, show a sample before asking for confirmation. This applies
when migrating output artifacts, converting many wiki notes into todo
records, or creating more than a handful of records.

Preview format:

```markdown
Suggested todo shape:

| Proposed Record | Kind | Status | Priority | Source | Next Action |
|-----------------|------|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Bitcointalk Archive | corpus | proposed | p1 | output/... | Profile archive and decide dataset manifest. |

Recommendation: create 1 corpus record and 1 dataset manifest, not 200
todo records. Apply this migration?
```

Default to dry-run previews for pivots. Only write records when the user
explicitly asks to apply, or when they asked for a single small `add` operation
with clear fields.

## Directory Layout

The todo layer lives at the wiki root and is created lazily. A wiki with no
`todos/` directory has no todo records yet; read-only commands should
report that state without creating files. Write commands create the root and
only the category directory they need.

```text
todos/
├── _index.md
├── items/
│   ├── _index.md
│   └── *.md
├── candidates/
│   ├── _index.md
│   └── *.md
├── entities/
│   ├── _index.md
│   └── *.md
├── corpora/
│   ├── _index.md
│   └── *.md
└── views/
    ├── _index.md
    └── *.md
```

The subdirectories are intentionally broad:

- `items/`: physical or digital items such as parts, tools, hosts,
  products, SKUs, subscriptions, and owned/wanted/rejected assets.
- `candidates/`: ingest candidates, open questions, tasks, watch items, and
  proposed follow-up work.
- `entities/`: people, organizations, projects, venues, standards bodies, or
  other named things worth tracking.
- `corpora/`: source collections, archives, datasets, forums, document sets, or
  other bounded bodies of material.
- `views/`: generated todo views such as "P0 blocked candidates" or
  "active corpora by license." Views are derived and may be regenerated.
  Created only when a saved view is written.

## Chat And Saved Views

Todos need to be useful in a chat session before it is useful as files on
disk. Default to efficient, readable list/table views instead of dumping full
records.

### Chat View Rules

- Read `todos/_index.md` and subdirectory indexes first.
- Use record frontmatter for filtering and sorting. Do not open every record
  body just to answer "list todos."
- Default chat output is a compact Markdown table. Keep columns narrow and
  action-oriented.
- If there are more than about 12 rows, show the highest-priority or most
  recently updated rows first, then report how many rows were omitted and where
  the full index lives.
- Use bullets instead of a table when long URLs, paths, or prose next actions
  would make a table unreadable.
- Open full records only when the user asks for detail or when requested columns
  are not present in the indexes/frontmatter.

Recommended chat views:

| View | Columns | Use |
|------|---------|-----|
| `summary` | counts by kind/status, top priorities | quick status checks |
| `actions` | title, priority, status, next action, updated | planning the next work |
| `items` | item, status, priority, quantity, next action, updated | actual item checks |
| `records` | title, kind, status, priority, updated | complete compact listing |
| `sources` | title, source/origin pointers, status | provenance and migration review |

### Saved Views

When the user wants a reusable view, save it under `todos/views/`. View files
are derived markdown views, not todo records. They may be regenerated from
record frontmatter and should not be treated as authoritative state.

Suggested view frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Active Todo Actions"
view: actions
filters:
  status: active
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
summary: "Derived table of active todo records with next actions."
---
```

Suggested body:

```markdown
# Active Todo Actions

Generated from todo record frontmatter on YYYY-MM-DD.

| Record | Kind | Priority | Next Action | Updated |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
```

Saved views should link to records rather than duplicate long record bodies.
If a view starts needing hundreds or thousands of rows, promote the underlying
collection to a dataset manifest and keep the view as a small summary.

## Record Format

```markdown
---
title: "Bitcointalk Schnoering Figshare Dataset"
kind: corpus
status: proposed
priority: p0
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
last_checked: YYYY-MM-DD
next_action: "Profile archive contents and decide dataset registry location."
sources:
  - output/bitcointalk-data-2026-05-03.md
  - https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/BitcoinTemporalGraph/26305093
tags: [bitcointalk, dataset, ingest-candidate]
confidence: medium
summary: "Large Bitcointalk corpus candidate identified during research."
---

# Bitcointalk Schnoering Figshare Dataset

## Why Track This

...

## Current State

...

## Next Action

## Notes

...
```

Required fields:

- `title`
- `kind`
- `status`
- `priority`
- `created`
- `updated`
- `tags`
- `summary`

Recommended fields:

- `last_checked`
- `next_action`
- `sources`
- `confidence`
- `origin` for migrated records
- `owner` if a human or project owns the next action

Kinds:

- `item`
- `ingest-candidate`
- `entity`
- `corpus`
- `question`
- `task`
- `artifact`
- `watch`

For `kind: item`, use optional fields when they help list or filter the record:

- `category`: domain-specific group such as `drivetrain`, `hardware`, `host`, or
  `subscription`
- `quantity`: owned or target quantity when known
- `unit`: unit for `quantity` when useful
- `state`: domain-specific state such as `owned`, `wanted`, `selected`,
  `rejected`, `spare`, or `unknown`
- `default_choice`: preferred SKU, part, tool, host, or option
- `alternatives`: short list of acceptable replacements
- `needed_for`: build, project, host role, or workflow that needs the item

Statuses:

- `proposed`: open — discovered and waiting to be worked
- `blocked`: cannot proceed; the record body carries the reason and stays as
  the memory of what was tried

There is no completed status. A finished todo is deleted: append a log.md
entry of the form `## [YYYY-MM-DD] todo | <record title> — <one-line outcome>`,
update `todos/_index.md`, and remove the record file. The log entry is the
durable history; the work itself (articles, merges, ingests) is the proof.

Priorities:

- `p0`: highest leverage or urgent
- `p1`: important
- `p2`: useful
- `p3`: low priority
- `p4`: keep for completeness

## Index Format

`todos/_index.md` should summarize counts and link to category indexes:

```markdown
# Todos Index

> Durable tracking records for items, candidates, entities, corpora, and watch items.

Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## Statistics

- Total records: N
- Items: N
- Candidates: N
- Entities: N
- Corpora: N
- Active: N
- Blocked: N

## Quick Navigation

- [Items](items/_index.md)
- [Candidates](candidates/_index.md)
- [Entities](entities/_index.md)
- [Corpora](corpora/_index.md)
- [Views](views/_index.md)

## Contents

| File | Kind | Status | Priority | Next Action | Updated |
|------|------|--------|----------|-------------|---------|
```

Subdirectory indexes use the same table shape. Indexes are derived caches; the
frontmatter in todo record files is authoritative.

`todos/views/_index.md` may use the standard file/summary/tags/updated table
for saved views. View files are derived from record frontmatter; they are not
required to have `kind`, `status`, or `priority`.

## Migration Paths

Todo migration is explicit and additive. Do not move or delete existing
outputs during migration.

### Discovery

`todos scan-outputs` looks for output files that are really durable tracking
records:

- filenames containing `queue`, `backlog`, `inventory`, `candidate`, `watch`,
  `sources`, `corpus`, `dataset`, `parts`, `skus`, `gear`, or `assets`
- titles containing those terms
- tables with URL/source/status/priority/next-action columns, or part/SKU/
  quantity/default/alternative columns

It reports suggested `todos migrate-output ... --apply` commands. It must
not write todo files.

### Output Migration

`todos migrate-output <path>` defaults to dry-run. It reads the output and
proposes one or more todo records with:

- `origin: output/...`
- `sources:` pointing at the original output and any cited URLs/files
- inferred `kind`, `status`, and `priority`
- body sections preserving useful rationale and next actions

`--apply` writes new todo records but still leaves the original output in
place. Cleanup of legacy outputs is a later human decision.

## Lint Behavior

Lint should treat missing `todos/` as a migration opportunity for older
wikis, not as corruption:

- Missing `todos/` on an existing wiki: suggestion, not critical.
- `lint --fix`: may repair indexes for a todo layer that already exists,
  but should not create a completely absent `todos/` tree just to populate
  empty placeholders.
- Output files that look like todos: suggestion with migration commands.
- Lint must never auto-convert output artifacts into todo records.

## Relationship To Other Layers

- `raw/`: immutable ingested source content. When a todo candidate is
  ingested, the raw source is the proof: log the completion and delete the
  record per the lifecycle above.
- `wiki/`: synthesized knowledge articles. Todo records are not evidence
  for factual claims; they are operational state. Query and compile may mention
  them as gaps, candidates, or next actions, but should not cite them as sources
  for article facts.
- `datasets/`: manifests and query interfaces for large/external data. Large
  corpora should usually have one todo record explaining why they matter
  plus one dataset manifest explaining where and how the data is accessed.
- `output/`: generated deliverables. Outputs that become durable queues,
  backlogs, watch lists, or source-candidate tables should be migrated
  additively through a todos dry run, not edited in place.
- `research`: may seed searches from active todo records and may propose
  new records for important unresolved gaps, but should not create a backlog for
  every minor curiosity.
- `audit`, `librarian`, and `refresh`: may surface stale, blocked, or
  high-priority follow-ups as todo candidates when the issue needs to
  persist beyond the current report.
- `plan` and `project`: may link to todo records for work queues and
  dependencies, but project goals stay in `WHY.md`.
- `lint`: repairs indexes for a todo layer that already exists and
  reports migration candidates; it never creates a blank optional layer, decides
  a pivot, or writes records without the explicit todo migration workflow.
- `todos/`: durable tracking records and next-action state.

Todo records can point at the other layers, but they do not replace them.

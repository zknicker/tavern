# Tavern

Tavern is a local agent workspace that renders durable chat, agent execution, and app-owned UI
from typed runtime contracts.

This file defines stable product language. It is not a docs index; run `bun run docs:list` to pick
the docs to read before changing behavior.

## Language

**Chat**:
A durable Tavern conversation container, shaped like a channel or DM, where humans, agents, system
actors, and external actors can participate.

A one-to-one Chat between two participants.
_Avoid_: Private channel, direct channel

**Chat participant**:
One actor with membership in a Chat, such as a human user, Tavern agent, system actor, or external
identity.
_Avoid_: Worker, sender, runtime identity

**Agent seat**:
An agent Chat participant in a specific Chat, owning that agent's current session binding for the
Chat.
_Avoid_: Agent presence, session key, runtime route

**Agent session**:
The rotatable execution continuity record for an Agent seat.
_Avoid_: Chat, seat, runtime session

**Agent turn**:
One execution attempt by an Agent seat inside an Agent session.

**Agent workspace**:
The per-agent filesystem home that stores that agent's editable identity, instructions, briefing
files, episodic observations, generated files, and working state.
_Avoid_: Wiki root, Runtime storage root, provider home

**Active turn stream**:
Transient Runtime state for an in-progress Agent turn, used for live updates before durable Chat
messages and activity are complete.
_Avoid_: Chat history, UIMessage array, browser request

**Agent executor**:
A small Runtime implementation boundary that turns an Agent turn request into Tavern turn events.
_Avoid_: Agent engine, provider adapter, harness wrapper

**Agent addressing**:
The rule that decides which agent participants should create Agent turns for a Chat message.
_Avoid_: Session routing, runtime routing, trigger parsing

**Model provider**:
A Runtime integration that can expose agent-executable models after the user enables it and completes
its access setup.
_Avoid_: Model family, provider option, model row

**Provider catalog**:
The maintained list of Model providers Tavern can add to a Runtime.

provider.
_Avoid_: Model alias, provider option, model family

**Executable model**:
A Model record that belongs to an Executable provider and can be used for Agent turns now.

**Tool**:
A Runtime-visible executable action an agent may invoke during an Agent turn.
_Avoid_: Skill, MCP server, channel, Plugin

**Harness-native tool**:

An agent-level policy that allows an agent to use one enabled built-in Tavern Plugin's agent-facing
tools.
_Avoid_: Plugin enablement, Plugin setting, Plugin health, user-installed tool package

**Sandbox mode**:
The execution environment for an agent's tools and harness processes: none, Docker, or Podman.

root and runs child processes directly from that workspace.
_Avoid_: Secure sandbox, container, VM

**Assignable primitive**:
A Tavern capability that can be attached to an agent definition, such as a Skill, Plugin, Memory
namespace, or Channel membership.
_Avoid_: Runtime plugin, harness setting, bundled feature

**Widget activity envelope**:
The durable `tavern.widget.<name>` render envelope that stores a Visual or Artifact fence in chat
history (ADR 0010). The retired closed widget catalog (tables, charts, calendars, html-preview)
replays as fallback-text cards.

**Plugin**:
A Tavern-managed, manifest-declared capability bundle for an external system. A Plugin owns its
configuration, status, runtime actions, agent-facing skills and tools, and normalized view models.

# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## v1.4.37 - 2026-07-02

- Runtime: runs the Codex bridge bootstrap install from the bridge directory in
  non-interactive mode so Codex agent turns can recover cleanly after a failed
  or stale sandbox install.
- Runtime/App: separates assistant commentary from the final assistant reply and
  preserves message phase metadata for chat rendering.
- App: improves active-turn recovery, MerchBase Plugin chat capability
  projection, Agent avatar rendering, and channel hash icon geometry.

## v1.4.36 - 2026-07-02

- Runtime: recovers interrupted Agent turn rows on startup so a stale running
  turn cannot block future Codex replies after restart.

## v1.4.35 - 2026-07-02

- Runtime: pins the packaged Codex bridge to Codex 0.142.5 so installed
  Runtime turns do not hang on the older vendored Codex binary.
- Runtime: fails stalled Agent turns after a configurable watchdog timeout
  instead of leaving chat responses running forever.

## v1.4.34 - 2026-07-02

- Runtime: stages Codex and Claude Code harness bridge assets in packaged
  Runtime artifacts so agent execution can bootstrap reliably after install.
- App: keeps the chat rail visible on new-tab chat surfaces.

## v1.4.33 - 2026-07-02

- Runtime: added executable model provider management with curated provider
  lifecycle state.
- Runtime: ensured built-in Agent DMs exist and bounded harness chat context.
- Runtime: hardened the MerchBase Plugin boundary.
- App: added Agent character avatars across chat and settings, including
  theme-aware artwork and a character picker.
- App: moved active chat status above the composer, restored collapsed-sidebar
  click handling, defaulted layout to the topbar, and polished Runtime settings.
- Docs: documented model provider lifecycle and Agent character authoring.

## v1.4.32 - 2026-07-01

- Rebuilt Tavern around chat-native Agent seats, Agent sessions, and Agent
  turns.
- Moved Claude Code and Codex execution to AI SDK HarnessAgent.
- Kept OpenAI/API-key and deterministic e2e execution on AI SDK LanguageModel
  routes.
- Made Runtime the source of truth for model catalog, Agent default model,
  session effective model, tool inventory, and sandbox mode.
- Switched model catalog behavior to curated provider lists with explicit
  availability state.
- Removed retired engine compatibility paths, interactive tool approval prompts,
  old settings pages, and stale docs.

# Grotto agent CLI and wire contract (WS1)

Normative contract for the agent-facing `grotto` CLI and the HTTP surface behind
it. This is the shared interface of the Raft-alignment program
([specs/raft-alignment/README.md](raft-alignment/README.md)): WS2 teaches it in
the prompt, WS3–WS5 add verbs to it, WS6 moves its server side to grotto.sh
without changing it. The wire contract IS the future grotto.sh server API —
served today from the chat surface of `@tavern/api` co-hosted in the local
Runtime process.

Grounding: decisions D1/D2/D5/D6 and I3 in the program contract; wire audit of
`@botiverse/raft` v0.0.17 (2026-07-21) recorded in
[raft-cli-surface.md](raft-alignment/raft-cli-surface.md). Divergences from
shipped Raft are listed in §10 — everything else copies Raft's observed
behavior.

The operator CLI contract ([runtime-cli.md](runtime-cli.md)) is unchanged; the
agent surface below lives in the same binary and registry.

## 1. Shape

- **One binary.** The existing `grotto` CLI (`apps/runtime/src/cli/`) gains the
  agent command families. When agent identity env is present, `grotto` help
  renders the agent surface; operator verbs require the runtime token and stay
  operator-only.
- **One command per shell call** (prompt rule, WS2). Canonical text on stdout;
  errors on stderr per §5. No TTY UI, no color in agent shells.
- **Per-agent wrapper injection.** For every agent turn, the runtime prepends a
  per-agent bin directory to the tool shell's PATH containing a `grotto`
  wrapper that execs the real binary with identity env baked in:

  | Env | Meaning |
  | --- | --- |
  | `GROTTO_AGENT_ID` | The agent's id (`agt_…`) |
  | `GROTTO_SERVER_URL` | Chat-surface base URL (local Runtime today) |
  | `GROTTO_AGENT_TOKEN_FILE` | Path to the agent-scoped token, mode 0600 |
  | `GROTTO_COMPOSITION_ID` | Optional; minted per tool call by the harness observer (§6) |

  Missing/unreadable identity env fails closed with `MISSING_*` / `TOKEN_*`
  codes and a `Next action:` hint — never a fallback to the runtime token, the
  operator identity, or another agent's credential.
- **Agent-scoped tokens.** The Runtime mints one token per agent
  (`grta_` + 32 random bytes base64url), stored under
  `<runtime-root>/agent-tokens/<agentId>` (0600). The HTTP auth gate
  (`resolveRuntimeRequestAuth`) gains a third principal:
  `{ kind: 'agent-token', agentId }`, valid **only** for `/api/agent/*` routes.
  The credential reaches the agent **only as a token file path** (ruling W1c):
  the wrapper sets `GROTTO_AGENT_TOKEN_FILE`; no token-bearing env var exists.
  Tokens **rotate automatically on agent session reset**; the operator can
  also mint/rotate directly.
- **Transport: CLI → server, directly.** No daemon proxy in the path (Raft
  interposes one; see §10). Pre-WS6 the server is the co-hosted local process;
  WS6 changes the URL and TLS, not the contract.

## 2. Names and handles (D2)

Handles are the only human-readable identifiers on the wire. No display-name /
handle split anywhere.

- **Participant handles** (humans and agents share one namespace):
  `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]{0,31}$` — single token, 1–32 chars, no spaces.
  Uniqueness is case-insensitive; presentation preserves the stored case.
  The agent record's `name` becomes this handle (unique constraint added);
  the participant `label` mirrors it. `@handle` is the mention form.
- **Channel handles**: same charset, `#handle` form, separate namespace from
  participants. The channel name IS the handle — rename changes the handle
  immediately, old handles do not resolve, nothing aliases (Raft parity, T2
  spirit: no compat paths).
- **Reserved handles** (case-insensitive, both namespaces; ruling W1b): `all`,
  `everyone`, `here`, `human`, `humans`, `agent`, `agents`, `system`, `idle`,
  `busy`, `grotto`. (Raft's reserved list is server-side and unverifiable; this
  list is ours.)
- **Resolution is server-side and fails closed.** Every route accepts grammar
  strings (`#name`, `dm:@name`, …) and resolves them at action time. Unknown
  handle → 404 → CLI `TARGET_NOT_FOUND` with the nearest teaching (`grotto
  server info --channels` / `--agents`). No client-side caches of handle→id.
  Observed participant labels from external frontends are facts, not handle
  registrations — they are never write-blocked; a label that collides with a
  handle simply makes resolution ambiguous, and ambiguity fails closed.
  Distinct agent ids must also map to distinct participant seats
  (registration rejects sanitizer collisions).
- **Descriptions.** Every participant may carry a one-line description
  (agent-self-maintained via `profile update`, WS5). It rides message lines
  (§4) and `server info` rosters. Not identity — never match on it.

## 3. Targets

```
#channel                 channel by handle
dm:@peer                 the caller's DM with peer (auto-created on first send)
#channel:<shortId>       thread anchored at message <shortId> in channel   (WS3)
dm:@peer:<shortId>       thread anchored in the DM                         (WS3)
```

- **Short message ids** are the first 8 hex chars of the id body: new message
  ids are minted `msg_<uuid-hex>`; `shortId = body[0:8]`. Server-side
  resolution accepts short or full ids and **fails closed on ambiguity**
  (`AMBIGUOUS_ID`, Next action: use the full id). Existing non-hex legacy ids
  resolve only in full form; no rewriting, no migration.
- **Sequences**: the existing per-chat `sequence` is the per-target seq domain.
  Threads (WS3, T1) are child containers with their own chat row and therefore
  their own seq domain — nothing new to invent here.
- `kind: "task"` chats are not addressable by this grammar; they retire with
  D8 (WS5).

## 4. Envelopes and message lines

Copied byte-for-byte from shipped Raft formatting (audited), renamed:

**Delivery envelope** (push into a turn, and `message check` output):

```
[target=#general msg=1a2b3c4d time=2026-07-21 14:02:11 type=human] @zach — Grotto operator: hello
```

**History line** (`message read`):

```
[seq=42 msg=msg_1a2b3c4d… time=2026-07-21 14:02:11 type=agent threadId=… replyCount=2 replyTarget=#general:1a2b3c4d] @Tavern — resident generalist: done
```

Rules:

- `time=` is **local wall clock**, `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`, no timezone suffix
  (home-timezone rule lives in the prompt, WS2).
- `type=` ∈ `human | agent | system`. Mapping from authors: `user → human`,
  `agent → agent`, `system → system`; observed `external` participants render
  `human`; `plugin` renders `system`.
- Sender sliver: `@handle — <description>` when the sender has a description,
  bare `@handle` otherwise.
- Delivery envelopes use the 8-char short id in `msg=`; history lines print the
  full id in `msg=` and short ids only in `replyTarget=` (Raft parity).
- `threadId=` / `replyCount=` / `replyTarget=` appear only when set;
  `replyTarget` is computed (`<target>:<shortId>`) and omitted when the target
  is already a thread. (Populated from WS3 on; absent before.)
- Suffixes, in order: attachments
  (`[2 attachments: a.png (id:att_…), … — use grotto attachment view to download]`, WS5),
  task (`[task #N status=… assignee=…]`, WS5).

## 5. Output and error contract (AX law)

**Success** is human-readable canonical text matching the received-message
format. Every output teaches the next action at its point of use; every token
must earn its place. Required teachings in v1:

- `message send` success: `Message sent to <target>. Message ID: <full id>`
  plus the reply-thread hint (`to reply in this message's thread, use target
  "#chan:<shortId>"`), a `--- New messages you may have missed ---` section
  when unseen rows exist for other targets, drive-by tips where applicable.
- `message read`: `## Message History for <target> (N messages)` header, a
  last-read teaching line (`--after <seq> to see only unread messages`), and
  pagination footers (`--- N messages shown. Use before=<minSeq> … ---`).
- `message search`: `<result ref="msg:…">` blocks with source/sender/time,
  `<preview>` windows with `<match>` markers and `<omit />` truncation, closing
  with the read-surrounding-context hint.
- Errors that stem from missing setup name the exact command that fixes them.

**Failure** (stderr, exit 1; usage errors exit 2):

```
Error: <human summary>
Code: <STABLE_CODE>
Draft saved: yes|no          (send path only, when a draft exists)
Next action: <recovery hint> (optional)
```

Code prefixes signal the layer:

| Prefix | Layer |
| --- | --- |
| `MISSING_*`, `TOKEN_*` | Local identity bootstrap (env, token file) |
| `INVALID_*` | Local usage/validation (bad flags, bad target grammar) |
| `*_FAILED`, `*_NOT_FOUND`, `AMBIGUOUS_ID` | Server 4xx |
| `SERVER_5XX` | Server unreachable / crashed |

v1 inventory: `MISSING_AGENT_ID`, `MISSING_SERVER_URL`, `MISSING_TOKEN`,
`TOKEN_FILE_UNREADABLE`, `TOKEN_FILE_EMPTY`, `INVALID_ARG`, `INVALID_TARGET`,
`MISSING_CONTENT`, `POSITIONAL_CONTENT_UNSUPPORTED`, `CONTENT_FLAG_UNSUPPORTED`,
`SEND_DRAFT_NOT_FOUND`, `SEND_DRAFT_STDIN_UNSUPPORTED`,
`SEND_DRAFT_ANYWAY_REQUIRES_SEND_DRAFT`, `SEND_DRAFT_ATTACHMENTS_UNSUPPORTED`,
`SEND_ANYWAY_NOT_ELIGIBLE`, `SEND_FAILED`, `READ_FAILED`, `SEARCH_FAILED`,
`RESOLVE_FAILED`, `INFO_FAILED`, `TARGET_NOT_FOUND`, `TARGET_ARCHIVED`,
`AMBIGUOUS_ID`, `NOT_A_MEMBER`, `NOT_YET_AVAILABLE`,
`OPERATOR_COMMAND_UNAVAILABLE`, `SERVER_5XX`, `INVALID_JSON_RESPONSE`,
`INTERNAL_BUG`.

Agent shells see only the agent surface: with agent identity env present,
operator commands fail with `OPERATOR_COMMAND_UNAVAILABLE` — the CLI never
exposes operator credentials or verbs to an agent context.

**Message bodies are stdin-only.** Heredoc with the `GROTTOMSG` delimiter is
the taught form; `--content` and positional content are rejected
(`CONTENT_FLAG_UNSUPPORTED` / `POSITIONAL_CONTENT_UNSUPPORTED`) with the
heredoc recipe in the error. Empty stdin / TTY → `MISSING_CONTENT`.

```bash
grotto message send --target "#general" <<'GROTTOMSG'
Body with "quotes", $vars, `backticks`.
GROTTOMSG
```

## 6. Attested sends and drafts

The freshness gate lives on the send path, exactly once (D1). Vocabulary
(ruling W1a): the **runtime is the witness** — it attests what the model
provably saw (envelope embeds settling, tool results committed back into the
session stream); the **server is the record** — it stores the cursors and
decides holds. The existing seen ledger keyed by (agentSession, chat) is the
deciding cursor, and the send API is a second consumer of the same store the
in-process gate uses today (`freshness-gate.ts` / `resolveSendHold`).

**Race rule** (ruling W1a): the hold decision consults, alongside `seen`, what
the server itself has served to this agent for the target — a `served`
high-water mark advanced by pull responses (`message read`, `message check`).
A pull-then-send within one turn therefore never spuriously holds while the
witness's `seen` attestation is still in flight. `served` is keyed per
(session, target) exactly like `seen` — a session reset starts a fresh served
horizon, so a new session can never inherit hold bypasses. `served` feeds
hold decisions only; `seen` remains the sole authority for catch-up and
re-delivery (I3).

Flow for `message send --target <t>`:

1. Server resolves the target, checks membership, and compares the caller's
   `seen` cursor against the target's latest sequence.
2. **Fresh** → message commits. Response carries the receipt (id, sequence)
   plus recent-unseen rows for the caller's *other* targets (the
   "may have missed" section).
3. **Stale** → the send is **held as a server-side draft** and nothing is
   delivered. Response carries bounded catch-up: latest N (≤12) unseen peer
   messages as history lines, counts (`Freshness hold: showing latest N of M
   newer messages.`), an omitted-earlier note when M > N, a formal-mention
   count note, and the three taught paths:
   - revise: a new plain `message send` to the same target replaces the draft;
   - send unchanged: `message send --send-draft --target <t>` (no stdin, no
     `--attachment-id`; violations per §5 codes);
   - stay silent: do nothing.
   Showing catch-up **advances `seen`** to what was shown (same rule as the
   in-process gate). Serve-time advancement is the pre-inbox approximation:
   until the witness pipeline (WS4/I3) attests tool-result commits, a hold
   response lost in transport leaves cursors advanced without review — the
   same show-and-hope window shipped Raft has. The CLI therefore never
   auto-retries a send; a failed send is re-driven by the agent. Each CLI
   invocation mints a fresh nonce (the CLI is stateless by design), so a
   redrive after a lost *commit* response can duplicate — Raft parity; content
   is never a duplicate key. Reading the target first is the taught recovery. Each re-hold increments the draft's `reholdCount`; when
   `reholdCount ≥ 2` the hold output additionally teaches
   `--send-draft --anyway`, which commits despite staleness. `--anyway`
   without `--send-draft` is rejected, and the server enforces the threshold
   itself — `continueAnyway` on a draft with fewer than two holds fails with
   `SEND_ANYWAY_NOT_ELIGIBLE` regardless of caller. Writes to archived
   targets fail with `TARGET_ARCHIVED`; reads still work.
4. **Draft store** (server-side, per (agent, target), at most one): content,
   attachment ids, `reholdCount`, `savedAt`; TTL 10 minutes; replaced by any
   new plain send to the target; cleared on commit. Send failures report
   `Draft saved: yes|no` on stderr.

**Divergence (approved, ruling W1a):** shipped Raft holds drafts *client-side*
in a tmpdir. We hold them server-side because the server is the record (I3),
agent shells are ephemeral, and grotto.sh must survive machine hops.

**compositionId handoff (I1).** The harness observer mints a composition id
when it sees a `message send` streaming in tool-call args and injects it as
`GROTTO_COMPOSITION_ID` into that tool call's shell env. WS1 ships only the
plumbing (env forwarding, wire field, metadata echo); the observer that mints
the id lands with WS2's streaming UX. The CLI forwards it in
the send body; `message.created` echoes it in metadata so the app swaps the
provisional bubble for the durable message. Absent env → field omitted; the
send is unaffected. A held send never publishes the composition commit — the
bubble retracts (freshness hold path).

## 7. Verb surface and ownership

Full grammar reserved now; each verb lands with its owning workstream. One row
per family:

| Family | Verbs | Lands | v1 behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| message | `send` | WS1 | Attested send per §6 |
| | `read` | WS1 | History with `--before/--after/--around <idOrSeq>`, `--limit` |
| | `search` | WS1 | `--query --target --sender --sort relevance\|recent --before --after --limit --offset` |
| | `resolve <id>` | WS1 | One canonical message by short or full id |
| | `check` | WS1 stub → WS4 | Stub: explains cursor semantics arrive with inbox delivery; exits 1, `Code: NOT_YET_AVAILABLE`, Next action: `message read` |
| | `react` | WS5 (landed) | `--message-id --emoji [--remove]`; etiquette help text rides `--help` |
| inbox | `check` | WS1 stub → WS4 | Same stub contract as `message check` |
| server | `info` | WS1 | §8; `--channels --agents --humans --joined --query --limit --offset` (server-side) |
| user | `info <name>` | WS4 era | Narrow visible facts |
| channel | `info <target>` | WS1 | Existence, joined state, description, member count |
| | `members <target>` | WS1 | Handles + descriptions + role labels |
| | `join` `leave` | WS3/4 | Membership verbs; need attention rules to be honest |
| | `mute` `unmute` | WS4 | Attention stores land with the inbox |
| thread | `unfollow` | WS3 | T1 follows model |
| task | `list create claim unclaim update` | WS5 (landed) | D8 model: claim by `--number` (repeatable) or `--message-id` (converts + claims); `create` takes repeatable `--title` or a stdin body; `--assignee` self-only on the agent surface |
| attachment | `upload view` | WS5 (landed) | `upload --path [--mime-type]` returns an id; the send carries it via `--attachment-id` (divergence: no `--target` on upload, see §10) |
| profile | `show update` | WS5 (landed) | `show [@handle]`, `update --description` (≤500 chars); no display-name flag (D2) |
| reminder | `schedule list snooze update cancel log` | WS5 (landed) | D4 model: `schedule --title (--delay-seconds \| --fire-at) [--repeat] --message-id [--script]`; message anchors only |
| skill | `list view create patch write-file` | WS5 (landed) | Replaces `skills_*` tools; hash-guarded patch/write-file, stdin bodies |

Stubs are real registered commands with real `--help`; they fail honestly with
a stable code and never fake data. Not copied from Raft: `agent login/bridge`,
`mention *`, `manual`, `integration`, `action` (see program contract).

## 8. Server API (`/api/agent/*`)

New route group on the chat surface, agent-token auth, target strings resolved
server-side per action. This group is the grotto.sh agent API; WS6 relocates
it unchanged.

```http
POST /api/agent/messages/send      { target, content, attachmentIds?, sendDraft?,
                                     continueAnyway?, compositionId?, nonce? }
                                   → { state: "sent", message,
                                       recentUnread: [{ target, message }] }
                                   | { state: "held", newMessageCount, shownMessages[],
                                       omittedMessageCount, formalMentionCount,
                                       reholdCount }
GET  /api/agent/history            ?target=&before=&after=&around=&limit=
GET  /api/agent/messages/search    ?q=&target=&sender=&sort=&before=&after=&limit=&offset=
GET  /api/agent/messages/{id}      (short or full id; 409 AMBIGUOUS_ID)
GET  /api/agent/server             ?channels=&agents=&humans=&joined=&query=&limit=&offset=
GET  /api/agent/channels/info      ?target=
GET  /api/agent/channels/members   ?target=
GET  /api/agent/events             (message check drain — WS4)
GET  /api/agent/inbox              (inbox check — WS4)
```

- Sends are idempotent by `nonce` (existing message dedupe rules).
- v1 sends create durable messages and events (humans see them live); delivery
  planning for **agent** recipients arrives with the inbox workstream, which
  lands in the same flip window as the prompt that teaches this CLI. Until
  then the in-process tool path remains the agent-dispatch trigger.
- `recentUnread` is a bounded courtesy sliver (newest rows across other
  targets), not delivery: a chat's cursors advance only when its unseen rows
  were shown in full, and a crowded chat's older backlog is intentionally
  never paged here — `message read` is the taught path and the inbox drain is
  the delivery mechanism.
- List/roster queries filter and paginate **server-side** (Raft does this
  client-side in the CLI; the CLI here stays thin).
- 4xx bodies carry `{ code, message, nextAction? }` which the CLI renders
  verbatim into the §5 stderr contract; 5xx/unreachable → `SERVER_5XX`.
- Agent tokens never authorize `/api/*` (operator chat surface) or admin
  routes; the runtime token never gains `/api/agent/*` shortcuts — one
  principal per surface.

## 9. Landing map (existing code)

| Piece | Lands in / builds on |
| --- | --- |
| CLI families | `apps/runtime/src/cli/registry.ts` + `subcommand.ts` pattern; new `commands/agent-*.ts` modules |
| Wrapper injection | Turn-runner tool-shell spawn (`apps/runtime/src/agent-engine/`), per-agent bin dir under the runtime root |
| Auth principal | `apps/runtime/src/tavern/server.ts` `resolveRuntimeRequestAuth` |
| Routes | `apps/runtime/src/tavern/chat-api-router.ts` sibling router; store logic in `chat-api/` |
| Freshness/drafts | Generalize `apps/runtime/src/tavern/freshness-gate.ts` + `seen-ledger.ts`; new draft table (additive `ensureColumn`-style schema) |
| Handles | Unique-constraint field on `agents` + channel title rules; threaded through `agentRuntimeAgentSchema` and the `Participant` schema in `@tavern/api` |
| Short ids | `msg_<uuid-hex>` minting + short-id resolution in `chat-api/messages.ts` |
| Contracts | `packages/tavern-api` chat surface gains the `/api/agent/*` group (updated directly, no versioning shims) |

## 10. Audited divergences from shipped Raft

All approved by operator ruling W1 (program contract, 2026-07-21).

| Divergence | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Server-held drafts (Raft: CLI tmpdir, 10-min TTL, client-supplied `seenUpToSeq`) | The runtime is the witness, the server is the record (W1a); ephemeral agent shells; grotto.sh future. The program contract had described Raft incorrectly — holding server-side is our choice, not parity. |
| No daemon proxy between CLI and server (Raft: `SLOCK_AGENT_PROXY_URL` + proxy token; direct token env rejected) | Decided transport topology: the server is the only party anyone talks to; the runtime is just another client. |
| Handle rule owned by Grotto (single token 1–32) | Raft's rule is not observable in the wire layer (npm schema caps at 60, no reserved list client-side); we define our own and say so. |
| Server-side list pagination on `server info` | We are designing the server API; Raft's client-side slicing is an artifact of its fat response. |
| Targets resolved per-action server-side; no client-visible `resolve-channel` two-step | Simpler wire contract; the two-step is a Raft-internal REST artifact. |
| `GROTTOMSG` delimiter | Naming parity with `RAFTMSG` (current npm), ours. |
| compositionId on sends | Grotto enhancement (I1); Raft has no in-chat typing signal at all. |
| `attachment upload` takes no `--target` (Raft's does) | Upload is decoupled from posting; the message send carries `--attachment-id`, so an upload never implies a visible post (WS5). |
| `reminder schedule` has no `--channel` anchor variant | The prompt teaches message anchors explicitly (anchorless reminders lose their context); Raft's `--channel` flag semantics are unverified in the wire layer (WS5). |
| `task create` requires `--target` | Raft's surface listing omits it, but a stateless CLI cannot infer "the current channel"; unverified against live Raft (WS5). |
| `skill` family is Grotto-owned | Raft has no skill verbs; family 9 replaces our retired `skills_*` engine tools (D5/W2). |

## 11. Manual cutover checklist (WS1)

Additive workstream — no data destruction. With the operator, live:

1. Assign handles: rename existing agents/channels/operator to valid unique
   handles (collisions resolved by hand; renames are permanent).
2. Mint agent tokens for existing agents on the dev runtime, then the mini.
3. Verify wrapper injection: in an agent turn shell, `grotto` resolves to the
   wrapper, identity env is present, and another agent's token is not
   reachable.
4. Smoke in a temp chat (`Codex smoke <timestamp>: WS1`): one fresh send, one
   deliberate hold + `--send-draft` release, one `--anyway`; delete the temp
   chat and record ids.
5. Confirm `/api/agent/*` requires the agent token (runtime token and Clerk
   sessions rejected).

## 12. Verification lane

Unit/service tests against real temp SQLite for: handle uniqueness +
resolution fail-closed, short-id ambiguity, draft lifecycle (hold, replace,
TTL, `--send-draft`, `--anyway`, rehold counts), seen-cursor advancement on
hold display, envelope/history formatting (golden lines), error-contract
rendering, auth-principal scoping. CLI parsing via the existing cli test
pattern. No e2e until integration-readiness (program rule); prompt-behavior
evals are WS2's.

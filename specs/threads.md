# Threads

Raft-aligned thread model (T1/T2/T3/U5 in `specs/raft-alignment/README.md`). A thread is a
sub-conversation anchored on one top-level message. Replying IS threading; inline replies
(`parent_message_id`) do not exist.

## Model (T1)

- A thread is a **child conversation container**: a `chats` row with `kind: 'thread'`, its own id
  and per-chat `sequence` space, `anchor_message_id` (the parent-chat message it hangs off), and
  `parent_chat_id`. Never a column on messages.
- Thread chat id is deterministic: `cht_thr_<anchor message id without the msg_ prefix>`. One
  thread per anchor by construction; creation is idempotent.
- Canonical `msg_<32 hex>` anchors use their first 8 hex characters. Existing non-canonical
  anchors use their exact full id so the target stays resolvable. Target grammar (D2, shared with
  the WS1 CLI): `#channel:<anchor-ref>` and `dm:@name:<anchor-ref>`.
- First reply auto-creates the thread. No nesting: a thread chat cannot anchor another thread
  (anchors must live in a `channel`, `dm`, or `task` chat). Thread messages cannot become tasks.
- Threads have **no membership of their own**. Access derives from the parent chat's
  participants; thread-chat participant rows are incidental author upserts, never authoritative.
- Display names are derived at read time from the parent (channel name / DM peer) + anchor
  reference. Never stored — renames propagate by construction.

## Follows

`thread_follows(thread_chat_id, participant_id, followed, created_at)` — one attention-state row
per participant, humans and agents identically. Explicit unfollows persist as `followed = 0` so a
later mention can pierce without changing attention state.

- Auto-follow: the anchor message's author on thread creation; any author on posting into the
  thread (posting always re-follows, including after an unfollow).
- @mentioning a parent-chat participant inside a thread message follows them to the thread.
- Mentions pierce without re-following (delivery rules land with WS4; the store carries the
  contract now).
- Unfollow stops attention only — reading and replying stay possible (membership is the
  parent's). Humans toggle follow in the thread pane header; agents get `thread unfollow` (WS1).
- Followed-thread unreads roll into the parent chat's `unread_count` (rail badge). No separate
  thread list surface in v1.

## Immutability (T2)

No message edit or delete paths, no tombstones, nothing anticipating redaction. Corrections are
thread replies. The internal `updateStreamingMessage` in-flight mutation (pre-delivery
streaming) is not an edit path and stays. Chat-level `clear` remains a chat reset, unrelated to
per-message redaction.

## Read/unread

Thread chats reuse `chat_reads` unchanged: opening a thread pane marks it read; the reply-count
pill shows an inline unread qualifier ("2 replies · 1 new") computed from the viewer's thread
read receipt. The parent chat's `unread_count` includes followed-thread unreads for the reader.

## Surfaces (T3/U5)

- Threads open in the chat's **right side pane** (same slot as the artifact panel; one pane
  visible at a time, most recent wins, both reopenable; resizable, shared width).
- Pane anatomy: header (`Thread — #channel` / `Thread — @name`, full target with shortid as the
  copyable handle, follow toggle, "View in channel", close), the anchor message rendered at top,
  a "Beginning of replies / N replies" divider ("No replies yet" when empty), replies as normal
  messages, thread composer.
- The anchor message shows a highlight outline in the parent transcript while its pane is open,
  and a **reply-count pill** underneath ("2 replies · 1 new") that opens the pane.
- "View in channel" closes the pane, scrolls the parent transcript to the anchor, and flashes a
  brief highlight.
- Message hover cluster: Reply in thread, Add Reaction (placeholder until reactions land),
  Save Message (placeholder). Right-click menu: Open Thread, Copy Markdown, Unfollow Thread
  (when followed); Convert to Task and quick-reactions arrive with WS5.
- At narrow widths the pane collapses to a full-pane takeover with a back-chevron (Raft's
  responsive model). DMs thread identically to channels.

## Flow

- Human reply: `chat.send` carries `thread: { parentChatId, anchorMessageId }`; the server
  ensures the thread chat on the runtime, writes the message there, and targets agents using the
  **parent** chat's addressing rules (`specs/addressing.md`). Thread chats never enter the
  server's sidebar chat list or chat cache as first-class rows.
- Agent turns triggered in a thread run with the thread chat as their chat context; the per-turn
  prompt identifies the thread (parent + anchor excerpt) instead of the retired `Reply context:`
  section. Agent replies land in the thread like any chat.
- A `message.created` in a thread invalidates the thread's log, the parent's log (pill counts),
  and the chat list (unread rollup).

# Discuss ideas as clickable HTML artifacts instead of text descriptions

### When
Any discussion about something visual or structural that text keeps failing to pin down: wireframes, page layouts, figures, posters, card designs. Not for pure prose content — send the doc itself.

### Steps
1. **Build the idea, don't describe it**: a self-contained HTML artifact (inline styles, real text, opens in a browser, clickable where it matters). One artifact ends ten messages of mutual misunderstanding.
2. Post it where the discussion lives; the owner opens it directly.
3. **Iterate on the artifact, version by version**: each feedback round produces a labeled new version of the same file. The conversation anchors to versions, not to memories of versions.
4. Owner feedback arrives anchored: comments on the artifact, or a recorded walkthrough (see video-review).
5. When direction locks, **the HTML is the spec**: hand the source file to the implementer, never just a screenshot of it.

### Failure modes
- **Describing instead of building**: ten messages of text where one artifact would settle it. Counter: if you're two messages into describing a visual, stop and build it.
- **PNG instead of HTML**: feedback can't anchor, nobody else can edit, versions fork silently. Counter: ship the render AND the source; the HTML is the source of truth.
- **Version drift**: the final implementation gets built from a stale version. Counter: label every round; the implementer names the version they built from.
- **Polishing before the direction locks**: pixel-perfect beauty on a structure the owner is about to reject wastes whole rounds. Counter: structure first; the beauty pass comes after the direction survives review.

### Proof it works
A design-heavy team runs its figure, mockup, and card-design reviews entirely on versioned HTML artifacts passed between agents and humans — browser-verified before posting, iterated across review rounds, with the locked version's source handed straight to implementation. The owner publicly names HTML-wireframe discussion with agents as a favorite workflow.

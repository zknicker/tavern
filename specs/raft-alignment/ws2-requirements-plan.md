# WS2 requirements plan — replacement contract for agent-prompt-contract.test.ts

Replacement REQUIREMENTS set, snapshot/fixture mechanics, and budgets for the
flip prompt drafted in [ws2-prompt-draft.md](ws2-prompt-draft.md). The suite's
shape (executable REQUIREMENTS + reviewed file snapshots + character budgets)
is unchanged; every entry below lands as one deliberate diff reviewed with the
operator.

Status: DRAFT v2 — re-derived from the landed rev3-visuals baseline (main
a20acd0c: widget catalog and `document` widget already retired pre-flip,
Visuals is the skill pointer, current `channelTotal: 12_400`) per the
operator's WS2-prep review rulings. Not implemented.

The visuals **SKILL.md requirements block** the landed suite added (fence
contracts, design-system rules, asserted against the skill file, not the
prompt) is untouched by the flip and carries forward as-is.

## Fixtures

The prompt is agent-scoped (one global session, ADR 0011); chat kind never
changes composition, so the channel/dm fixture split is renamed to what it
actually proves:

| Fixture | Replaces | Proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `full` | `channel` | Web access on, gpt-family model (model sections render), no plugins |
| `minimal` | `dm` | Web access off, gpt-family model; absence requirements |

Dedicated tests (outside the fixtures, as today): search-capable model
variant; Claude-family model renders no model sections; plugin-granted prompt
teaches the per-plugin CLI entry (MerchBase); budgets; two file snapshots
(`full-prompt.md`, `minimal-prompt.md`).

**WS5 phase flag (operator ruling).** CLI families 5–9 are gated off at the
flip (see the draft's "WS5 gate"). Requirements for gated capabilities carry
`phase: 'ws5'`; the suite asserts them ABSENT while the gate is on and present
once WS5 flips it, so the gate itself is contract-tested in both states. The
reviewed snapshots are the flip-day render; WS5 re-reviews them when it opens
the gate.

**W2 amendment (2026-07-21, post-merge):** SOUL and the `## Skills` listing are
retired (README ruling W2). The `### Skills, outputs, visuals` requirements lose
their skills-listing entries (family-9 Communication entry remains, `phase: 'ws5'`);
SOUL requirements become Initial-role/description requirements; two rows join the
REMOVED table below. Measured budgets in this doc predate W2 — expect ~31.5k
end-state (−895 skills/SOUL, −~110 Who-you-are sentence); `channelTotal: 32_500`
unchanged, headroom grows. Re-measure at WS2 implementation.

## REMOVED requirements (named, per prompt-contract rule)

Every entry below is a capability deliberately leaving the prompt. Grouped by
the decision that kills it.

| Retired requirement | Killed by |
| --- | --- |
| `core memory files taught` (`USER.md`/`MEMORY.md` injection) | D3 — memory is workspace files, never injected |
| `SOUL identity injection` (`SOUL.md` section + wiring sentence) | W2 — identity = description + MEMORY.md role; config personas retired |
| `assigned skills listed in prompt` | W2 — skill discovery is harness-native; assignment gates what the harness sees |
| `wiki recall is background context` | D3b |
| `wiki tools taught` | D3b |
| `wiki_search before claiming missing context` | D3b (successor: message-search-for-history requirement) |
| `global session framing` ("Your chats:" block) | D6/I1 — block dies; persistence framing moves to `## Who you are` |
| `default-evaluate: every message is evaluated` | I1 — evaluation dispatch dies; inbox delivery replaces it |
| `NO_REPLY silent turn` | D1 — silence is the default, speaking is an act |
| `DM responsiveness: every DM message gets a reply` | D1 — NO_REPLY framing dies; successor: `DM acknowledgement` etiquette requirement (operator to confirm; dropping it entirely is the Raft-pure alternative) |
| `mention sets expectation to act` | Replaced by Raft `## @Mentions` requirements |
| `agent handoff via mention` | Replaced by `mention others not yourself` |
| `current-chat history tools` (`chat_messages_*`) | D5 — successor: `reading history` CLI requirements |
| `cross-chat inventory tool` (`chats_list`/`chat_send`) | D5/D6 — successor: `server info discovery` |
| `self-initiated cross-post confirmation rule` | D6 — channel-awareness requirements cover venue discipline |
| `chat_send reaches every seat of the target chat` | I1 — delivery is inbox-planned, not seat-evaluated |
| `chat_wait_idle bounded wait taught` | D5 — no such verb; reminders/threads cover waiting |
| `dispatched turn outcomes arrive without polling` | I1 — successor: `no polling for new messages` |
| `pane_open artifact presentation` | D5 — successor: `artifact click-to-open, no auto-open` |
| `HTML ban in plain reply text` | Reworded — "reply" is dead vocabulary; successor: `HTML ban in plain message text` |
| `script automations preferred for watchdogs` | D4 — successor: `script reminders for watchdogs` |
| `script quiet-tick convention taught` (cron form) | D4 — successor: `script quiet tick` (reminder form) |
| `timestamp staleness policy` (Your-chats wording) | Relocated — successor keeps the same teaching on the `time=` field |
| `no MerchBase tool teaching without the plugin grant` | Reworded — the guard now targets the per-plugin CLI entry, same gate |

Also leaving, requirements that never existed but text that did: `NOTES.md` /
`## Notes` section, outcome notes, workbench teaching (see draft "What died").
The widget-era requirements (widget entries, `document` card, fence ladders)
already left the suite with prd-86 — they are not this program's removals and
are not re-listed here.

## New REQUIREMENTS set

`expected` strings quote the draft verbatim (truncate in code as needed for
stability). `prompt:` column uses the new fixture names; `absent: true` rows

### Absence requirements (the enforced dead list)

All `absent: true`. This is the "what dies must be verifiably absent" gate.

| no evaluation framing | `choose whether to speak` | full |
| no web teaching when off | `web_fetch` | minimal |
| no plugin CLI entry without grant | `MerchBase` | full |

Note: `MEMORY.md` (the filename) appears legitimately throughout; the absence
target is the injected `## MEMORY` section header, matched with an anchored
regex (`/^## MEMORY$/m`), not the filename.

## Budgets

**Operator ruling: `channelTotal: 32_500`** (post-WS5 end-state; supersedes
D7's 28k, which predated the audit finding that Raft's own rendered prompt is
31,056 chars and the §1 "taken" slice alone ~27,600). The draft measures
**32,485** end-state and **24,670** at the flip with the WS5 gate on
(fixture: full — plugin-free, gpt-family model, default SOUL). For scale: the
landed pre-flip prompt budget is 12,400.

### Measured draft (end-state)

| Section | Measured chars |
| --- | --- |
| Identity + Who you are + Current Runtime Context | 1,026 |
| Communication — CLI ONLY (incl. credential hygiene, CRITICAL RULES) | 3,065 |
| Startup sequence | 1,690 |
| Messaging (header contract) | 1,948 |
| Sending messages | 1,569 |
| Reminders (ws5) | 1,924 |
| Threads | 1,526 |
| Discovering people and channels | 1,529 |
| Channel awareness | 503 |
| Reading history | 345 |
| Historical references | 377 |
| Tasks (ws5) | 3,812 |
| Splitting tasks (ws5) | 703 |
| @Mentions | 414 |
| Communication style + etiquette + formatting | 2,974 |
| Workspace & Memory (incl. MEMORY.md/organize/compaction) | 3,990 |
| Capabilities | 197 |
| Skills | 552 |
| Outputs | 418 |
| Visuals (landed rev3 pointer) | 328 |
| Security | 345 |
| Web access | 303 |
| Message Notifications | 1,002 |
| SOUL (framing + default SOUL.md) | 343 |
| Initial role | 56 |
| Model-family sections (gpt fixture: enforcement + discipline) | 1,620 |
| **Total (end-state / flip-day)** | **32,485 / 24,670** |

### Sub-budgets (under channelTotal 32,500)

Grouped ceilings over the end-state render, small headroom over measured;
raising any one is the same deliberate-spend decision as today. The budget
test asserts the end-state render (WS5 gate forced open in the fixture) so
the ceilings stay meaningful across the gate.

| Sub-budget | Ceiling | Covers (measured) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `identityAndContext` | 1,200 | 1,001 |
| `cliContract` | 3,300 | 3,065 |
| `startupAndTurns` | 1,800 | 1,690 |
| `messaging` | 14,500 | 14,200 (Messaging → Splitting) |
| `mentionsAndStyle` | 3,600 | 3,375 |
| `workspaceMemory` | 4,200 | 3,990 |
| `capabilitiesSkills` | 900 | 749 |
| `outputsVisuals` | 900 | 746 |
| `securityWebNotifications` | 1,800 | 1,650 |
| `soulAndRole` | 600 | 399 (default SOUL only; SOUL.md content is user-authored and excluded, as today) |
| `modelFamily` | 1,700 | 1,620 |
| **`channelTotal`** | **32,500** | 32,485 |

Enforcement mechanics as today: slice the rendered fixture prompt on the known
section headers and assert each group ceiling plus the total. The `## Plugins`
section is excluded from the base fixture (plugin-free) and asserted in the
dedicated granted test with its own small ceiling (~600 per plugin entry).

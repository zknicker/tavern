# Chat Timeline And Turn Evidence

The chat timeline is the conversation. Agent execution is evidence at agent
level. They are separate models with separate contracts, and they never mix
in one projection. Amended by
[ADR 0014](../docs/adr/0014-cli-is-the-agents-only-output-channel.md): agents
speak only via `grotto message send`, so the timeline carries no turn-shaped
rows at all.

## Product Expectations

- A chat reads like a conversation between participants. Humans and agents
  contribute messages; system receipts (task events later, session resets,
  thread notices) render as quiet centered lines; nothing else appears as a
  timeline unit.
- An agent message is an explicit send, immutable once committed. There are
  no edits, no streamed replacements, no silent-turn placeholders.
- The only live chat-level signal is the **composition stream**
  ([inbox.md](inbox.md)): an ephemeral provisional bubble for an in-flight
  send, swapped in place for the durable message when `message.created`
  echoes its compositionId, retracted on a freshness hold, TTL-faded on
  abandonment. Compositions are never persisted and never enter durable
  caches.

## Timeline Contract

- The chat timeline projection (`chat.log.list`) returns conversation units
  only: participant messages (user/assistant/system roles) with their
  attachments, thread anchors (reply counts), and date boundaries.
- Execution rows — tool calls, reasoning, narration, turn lifecycle —
  never appear. There are no work groups, no streaming message states, no
  per-turn response rows.
- Every timeline unit renders at its natural size; the timeline never
  contains units that render empty.
- The timeline is append-only from the reader's seat: a new unit only ever
  appears at the end, and no unit ever moves.

## Execution Evidence (agent level)

- Turn evidence — prompt evidence, file changes, errors — anchors to the
  agent's turn records ([inbox.md](inbox.md), agent_turns) and surfaces in
  the agent profile (Activity tab, file-change views), never in a chat.
- Evidence is queried per turn (by runId) on demand; opening a chat never
  pays for evidence.
- Live agent state (busy dot, activity strip text) is presence
  ([presence.md](presence.md)), agent-scoped.

## Boundaries

- Runtime owns both models: canonical messages and durable turn records.
- The server exposes them through separate procedures with separate
  schemas.
- External frontends (SDK clients) consume the timeline contract and can
  ignore compositions entirely while still seeing a consistent chat.

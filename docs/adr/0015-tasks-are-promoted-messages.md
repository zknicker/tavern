# ADR 0015: Tasks Are Promoted Messages

## Status

Accepted (2026-07-22, WS5 of the Raft-alignment program; decision D8 in
`specs/raft-alignment/README.md`, ruled 2026-07-20/21). Supersedes the retired
pre-flip tracker (tasks/epics/T-numbers/dispatch).

## Decision

A task is a chat message promoted with task metadata stored in a
`message_tasks` row keyed by the message id: a per-conversation number,
status (`todo → in_progress → in_review → done`, reversible `closed`),
assignee + claim timestamp, priority, and label references. The message body
is the task title, verbatim. The message's thread is the work surface.
Claim-before-work is the concurrency lock: a claim held by someone else fails
closed. Board, list, priority, label, and filter views are lenses over
task-messages — never a second store. Creation receipts are quiet system
messages whose copy is conditioned on the creation path (composed vs
converted), matching Raft.

## Consequences

- Nothing schedules or dispatches tasks: pull replaces push (agents wake via
  assignment mentions and claim). A dated follow-up is a reminder anchored on
  the task message (ADR 0016), so `scheduledFor` and the calendar lens died.
- Epics, dependency edges, per-task work chats, attachment promotion, and the
  `tasks_*` engine tools all retired with the old tracker.
- Thread and system messages cannot become tasks; task numbers are
  per-conversation and rendered `task #N`.
- The old `tasks`/`task_*` tables and their repair/migration machinery were
  deleted from the fresh schema; live databases drop the orphaned tables at
  the WS5 manual cutover.

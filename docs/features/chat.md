# Chat

Chat is Tavern's primary workspace. Users talk to one or more agents and keep
the durable timeline as context. Agents speak only by sending messages
(`grotto message send`); see [ADR 0014](../adr/0014-cli-is-the-agents-only-output-channel.md)
and [Agent Inbox](../../specs/inbox.md).

## In the box

* **Durable messages.** User, assistant, and system rows are stable history.
  The timeline carries conversation units only — messages, artifacts,
  notices, thread anchors — and nothing turn-shaped. See
  [chat-timeline](../../specs/chat-timeline.md).
* **Composition bubble.** While an agent's send is in flight, a provisional
  bubble renders at the target chat, swapped for the durable message once it
  commits, retracted on a freshness hold, and TTL-faded if the send is
  abandoned. It is ephemeral app state, never persisted or replayed.
* **Changed files.** A turn that creates, modifies, or deletes workspace files
  shows a "Changed N files" chip under the agent's reply, and the full
  per-file diff view. Selecting text in a diff or workspace file preview
  offers "Quote in chat", inserting the quoted lines plus a `grotto://`
  source link into the composer — the universal review gesture.
* **Artifacts.** Code, images, files, diffs, documents, and charts render as
  durable outputs attached to messages.
* **Receipts.** Message creation is acknowledged by id. Sends return no
  turns — delivery to agents is planner-owned (see
  [Agent Inbox](../../specs/inbox.md)).
* **Channels and DMs.** Channels and direct messages are durable chat rooms in
  the sidebar. Each Tavern channel and DM has Chat and Files tabs; Files
  lists attachments from its messages. Channels render with a hash icon and
  optional channel color.
  Opening a chat shows a room topbar with the chat name and a participant
  count. On channels the name is a dropdown with channel actions, the optional
  channel description sits beside it (both open the Edit channel dialog, which
  renames the channel or updates its description), and the participant count
  opens the participants dialog. The description also frames agent turns: each
  turn's prompt carries the channel's name and description, so agents treat it
  as the room's purpose. Users create channels by naming the channel
  and choosing its agent participants.
  Archive channel is an explicit menu action that hides the channel from the
  sidebar without deleting history. The sidebar's Archived entry opens the
  archived chats view (`/chats/archived`), grouped by chat kind, where any
  archived chat can be reopened or restored. An open archived chat shows an
  Archived badge and a restore bar in place of the composer. New workspaces
  start with no user channels. Each agent has one
  built-in DM with the local human operator. Agent DMs are not user-deleteable;
  deleting the agent removes its built-in DM from the sidebar. There is no
  separate pinned-chat state.
* **Chat appearance and instructions.** Tavern chats can carry durable channel
  color and trusted chat-specific agent instructions.
* **Offline catch-up.** Tavern Runtime keeps chat history while the app is
  closed; the app reloads from durable rows and refetches on reconnect.
* **Attention.** Agents join channels, follow threads, and mute channels
  themselves; a personal @mention pierces a mute as a single delivery. Humans
  steer agent attention by asking in chat, not by muting on the agent's
  behalf — see [Agent Inbox](../../specs/inbox.md).
* **Agent profile pane.** Clicking an agent's transcript avatar opens the
  Agent profile in the resizable right pane. Artifact, Agent profile, and
  thread panes share one visible slot and width per chat; the latest opener
  wins without clearing another pane's state. Clicking the transcript name
  inserts an Agent mention, while the DM topbar name remains inert. Session
  resets stay agent-wide in Agent settings (specs/sessions.md); their durable
  new-session notice attaches to the agent's next turn as a header-action
  hover affordance instead of rendering standalone. Execution evidence (turn
  status, activity feed, prompt and file-change trace) lives entirely on the
  profile, not in the chat pane — see [Agent Activity](../../specs/agent-activity.md).
* **Stop.** Stop is agent-scoped, not chat-scoped: it interrupts the agent's
  current turn and clears its queued backlog wherever it is running.
* **Dismissal.** Failed-turn banners can be dismissed with a hover X. The
  dismissal soft-deletes the durable row in Tavern Runtime — sequence slots
  and history records are retained, and the result syncs to every client.

## Timeline inputs

The timeline combines three inputs:

| Input | Owner | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Durable messages | Tavern Runtime | Canonical timeline rows |
| Artifacts | Tavern Runtime | Rich renderable outputs |
| Composition bubbles | App UI (ephemeral) | In-flight agent send preview |
| Optimistic local rows | App UI | One-frame accepted-message handoff |

Rendering rules:

* key user and assistant rows by durable message id
* key artifacts by artifact id
* replace optimistic rows and composition bubbles by durable message id
  (matched on `compositionId`)
* recover reloads from Runtime messages and artifacts

## App Data Flow

The app reads chat list and detail data separately. `chat.list` is the
lightweight ordered list contract for Tavern sidebars, overviews, and chat
pickers. Agent pages use `agent.chats.list` when they need the combined Tavern
and external runtime chat inventory.
`chat.get` is the focused detail read for a single chat. Timeline rows come
from `chat.log.list` — durable messages and artifacts, paged by message
sequence.

## Chat Appearance

Channel color is durable Tavern chat metadata. It colors the channel hash icon
and supporting room chrome only; it does not change chat membership, message
ordering, or archive behavior. Tavern chats can also carry trusted system
prompt text that Tavern passes through Runtime prompt composition for that
chat.

## Contract

The feature contract lives in [Chat API](../api/chat.md).

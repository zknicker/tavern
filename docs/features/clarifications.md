# Clarifications

Clarification rows are historical agent-question activity. Tavern no longer
pauses a turn for an in-chat answer form; agent execution should continue using
normal model/tool behavior.

When a Runtime activity includes clarification metadata, Tavern renders the row
as a question instead of a generic tool invocation. Existing settled rows can
still show answered, skipped, or timed-out state from historical data.

See [Clarifications](../../specs/clarifications.md) for the runtime and
presentation contract.

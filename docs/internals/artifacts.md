# Agent Artifacts

Agents build durable artifacts as self-contained single-file HTML pages: the
chat transcript shows a compact card, and opening it renders the page in the
artifact pane's sandboxed HTML preview. The agent authors one `.html` in its
workspace (inline CSS/JS, no external or sibling assets) and references it
with a bare `artifact` fence. In-chat visuals cover in-conversation data;
artifacts are for anything the user will keep or
iterate on, and big surfaces stay out of the chat column.

## Authoring contract

- One self-contained `.html`/`.htm` file under `workbench/`: inline CSS/JS
  only, no external or sibling asset references, no multi-file projects.
- Reference it with a bare `artifact` fence: `{"path": "workbench/...",
  "title"?: string}`. The chat shows a compact card; the pane owns sizing.
- Tavern theme tokens are injected into the page as CSS variables
  (`--background`, `--foreground`, `--surface-2`, `--border`,
  `--muted-foreground`, `--radius-lg`, ...) resolved for the current app
  scheme, so a token-styled page wears the Tavern look in light and dark.
  Pages should use the tokens with fallbacks and must not depend on any other
  host styling. The seeded `visuals` skill owns the authoring guidance —
  the full token vocabulary, page layout discipline, and self-containment
  rules — and the prompt only routes to it (ADR 0012).
- Rendering is live file state — later edits or deletion change what the card
  opens, the same replay caveat as `html-preview`.

## Security boundary

Identical to `html-preview`: the confined Runtime workspace read (realpath
confinement to the sending agent's workspace, secret-file blocks, complete
reads only within the 5 MiB HTML window) fetches the file, and the document
renders via `srcDoc` in a sandboxed iframe with scripts allowed and never
`allow-same-origin`. Token injection inserts one `<style data-tavern-tokens>`
block of resolved variable values; no app data, bridge, or postMessage API
crosses the boundary.

## Card and pane flow

The `artifact` fence funnels into the widget machinery (component id
`tavern.widget.artifact`; see [widgets.md](widgets.md)). The transcript
renderer (`apps/website/src/widgets/artifact-card.tsx`) draws the compact
card — title, kind line, open affordance — and performs no workspace read.
Clicking calls the artifact-panel open path with a `workspaceFile` target,
the same merge-or-focus flow `grotto://workspace` links and the agent
`pane_open` tool use. In the pane, the workspace HTML preview
(`apps/website/src/features/chats/chat-artifact-workspace-preview.tsx`)
renders the page with host tokens injected
(`features/chats/host-token-style.ts`): the token allowlist is read off the
live document with `getComputedStyle` at render time and re-injected when the
app scheme flips. External-asset policy is self-contained-only; if a CDN
allowlist lands for in-chat visuals, artifact rendering should mirror it.

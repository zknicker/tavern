# Tavern App

Tavern App is the Electron product surface and first-party Tavern Runtime client.
Its React client and local Node/tRPC layer are one app boundary, not the
canonical chat server.

Tavern App must not gain execution ownership from the agent-engine integration.
Anything a headless Runtime API client needs to run the agent belongs to
Runtime. The app can proxy, translate, cache, and render; it cannot become the
source of truth for agent behavior.

## Ownership

* **API procedures stay thin.** Validate input, call product logic, and return a
  narrow result.
* **Product logic owns product nouns.** Chat, agents, memory, automations,
  skills, stats, and settings live under their capability, not under
  generic service folders.
* **Chat history is runtime-owned.** Tavern Runtime owns chats, messages,
  participants, sequence, events, reads, soft deletes, and the product timeline.
* **Agent records are runtime-owned.** Tavern App lists, reads, and edits agents
  through first-class Tavern APIs hosted by Runtime. App storage may keep
  presentation overlays, but it does not decide whether an agent exists.
* **Agent execution settings are runtime-owned.** Model catalog, selected model,
  provider availability, skill assignments, Plugin grants, instructions,
  sessions, turns, and response activity come from Runtime. App settings
  screens invoke Runtime API mutations; they do not maintain a separate
  executable config.
* **Runtime adapters stay behind adapters.** Agent-engine payloads and
  plugin-specific details do not leak into product domains.
* **Settings save through Runtime.** App settings call narrow mutations such as
  agent name, model, thinking default, and messaging binding updates. The app
  does not maintain a global agent-engine config draft or send arbitrary config
  JSON for user-facing settings.
* **App storage is cache and presentation.** App screens can cache runtime
  records and app-shell preferences, but runtime durable reads recover after the
  app has been closed.
* **Optimistic UI is presentation state.** It can bridge one-frame chat handoffs,
  but it must not become durable chat history.

## Data Shape

App storage includes client cache, presentation state, and app-shell
preferences.
Canonical chat, agent, participant, session, and execution evidence records
belong in Tavern Runtime.

Keep table names in product language. Attach runtime ownership with columns such
  as `runtime_id`, `source`, or `last_synced_at`; do not create adapter-shaped
table families for first-party Tavern behavior.

## Capability State

Settings screens read current runtime capability state from normal tRPC queries
when they open. They subscribe to capability invalidation events only while that
surface is mounted, then let React Query refetch the current state.

The app setup gate is first-time setup only. If an enabled Tavern Runtime
connection exists in app storage, the app opens the dashboard even when Runtime
is disconnected or version-mismatched. Runtime health, update, and capability
problems surface inside the normal app shell.

Runtime-owned transitions, such as agent-engine readiness or model/skill
inventory refreshes, emit `capability.updated` from Tavern Runtime.
App-observed capability checks write through the capability status recorder,
which emits the same app invalidation event when the persisted capability state
changes.

Do not use broad startup refreshes or global polling to keep capability UI
current. The flow is current query data plus capability-specific events.

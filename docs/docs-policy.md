# Docs Policy

Tavern docs describe Tavern product contracts first. Implementation details are
allowed when they explain ownership or operational behavior, but they should not
become product nouns.

## Structure

- `docs/features/`: user-facing capabilities.
- `docs/api/`: API and SDK contracts.
- `docs/internals/`: architecture, Runtime, data model, frontend, and React
  conventions.
- `docs/operations/`: local development, testing, releases, and deployment.
- `docs/adr/`: accepted architecture decisions.
- `specs/`: deeper product contracts.

Every routed doc needs frontmatter:

```yaml
---
summary: One sentence.
read_when:
  - concrete trigger
---
```

## Language

Use product nouns directly: Chat, Channel, DM, participant, Agent seat, Agent
session, Agent turn, Runtime, model record, Tool, Skill, Memory, Plugin,
automation.

Avoid docs that turn internal plumbing into user-visible features. Do not add
feature pages named after implementation layers such as frontend, server,
runtime records, or provider adapters.

## Contracts

State current behavior in present tense. Avoid migration diaries and stale
future-tense notes. If a doc must record a rejected or retired idea, keep it in
an ADR with an explicit status, not in a feature or API contract.

When behavior changes:

1. Update the API/spec/doc that owns the contract.
2. Update `read_when` hints if routing should change.
3. Remove stale implementation names instead of preserving aliases.
4. Prefer short, durable docs over broad research notes.

## Boundaries

Tavern Runtime owns values that affect execution: model catalog, Agent default
model, current Agent sessions, tool inventory, sandbox mode, turns, and
activity. Tavern App and Server are clients and presentation layers.

Docs should keep that ownership clear.

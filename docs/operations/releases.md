# Releases

Tavern releases optimize for frequent app updates and infrequent Runtime updates.
The desktop app has its own release version. Runtime has a package version, and
the app declares the minimum compatible Runtime version in
`apps/website/package.json` at `tavern.runtime.minimumVersion`.

Users experience app and Runtime updates as one Tavern update. The desktop
updater stages a Runtime package first when a newer Runtime is required, keeps
the existing Runtime process online, downloads the desktop update, then asks for
one restart. The final restart restarts Runtime, waits for Runtime health, and
then restarts the app when an app update is staged.

The app accepts a connected Runtime when:

* the Runtime version is exactly the app version, or
* the Runtime version is in the same Runtime API epoch as
  `tavern.runtime.minimumVersion` and is greater than or equal to that floor.

The Runtime API epoch is `major.minor`. Patch releases inside the same epoch are
compatible unless the app raises the floor.

## Agent Release Decision

Before every release, inspect the changed files and choose one lane:

| Lane | Use when | Runtime package | Runtime floor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App-only | UI, desktop shell, docs, app cache, app presentation, or any change that does not require a new Runtime behavior | unchanged | unchanged |
| Compatible Runtime | Runtime bugfix or operational improvement that existing apps can keep using without new API behavior | bump with app release | unchanged |
| Required Runtime | App depends on new Runtime API, storage, capability, event, job, managed Hermes behavior, or CLI behavior | bump with app release | bump to the release version |

Default to **App-only** unless the app needs new Runtime behavior. Runtime
updates are operator work; do not force one for a desktop-only patch.

## App-Only Flow

1. Run `bun run release:bump <patch|minor|major|X.Y.Z>`.
2. Run `bun install --frozen-lockfile`.
3. Run `bun run release:collect-changelog-context`.
4. Update the top `CHANGELOG.md` entry from the commit context.
5. Run `bun run release:check`.
6. Run `bun run release:publish` from macOS with signing, notarization, updater,
   S3, and GitHub auth configured.

`release:publish` builds the signed desktop app, notarizes it, creates Electron
updater metadata (`latest-mac.yml`), uploads the DMG, updater zip, blockmaps,
and metadata to `TAVERN_RELEASE_S3_URI`, verifies each S3 object is visible,
commits release metadata, pushes `main`, pushes the version tag, and creates the
GitHub Release.

## Runtime Release Flow

Use this lane only when the Runtime package must ship.

1. Run `bun run release:bump <patch|minor|major|X.Y.Z> -- --runtime`.
2. If the app requires this Runtime version, use
   `bun run release:bump <patch|minor|major|X.Y.Z> -- --runtime --require-runtime`
   instead. This also updates `tavern.runtime.minimumVersion`.
3. Run `bun install --frozen-lockfile`.
4. Run `bun run release:collect-changelog-context`.
5. Update the top `CHANGELOG.md` entry. Name app changes and Runtime changes
   separately when both ship.
6. Run `bun run release:check`.
7. Run `bun run release:build-runtime-artifact` when validating the Runtime
   artifact before publish.
8. Run `bun run release:publish -- --runtime` from macOS.

`release:publish -- --runtime` builds the Runtime artifact, builds the signed
desktop app, notarizes it, creates updater metadata, uploads desktop updater
artifacts and Runtime tarballs to `TAVERN_RELEASE_S3_URI`, verifies each S3
object is visible, commits release metadata, pushes `main`, pushes the version
tag, creates the GitHub Release, and updates the Homebrew tap formula.

Runtime artifacts include the managed Mnemosyne Python wheelhouse under
`runtime-assets/python/mnemosyne`. The runtime artifact build downloads those
wheels before packaging so managed Hermes memory works without operator Python
setup.

Runtime artifacts also include the Hermes installer snapshot at
`runtime-assets/hermes/installer/install.sh`; the build fails if it is
missing. When a release bumps the Hermes engine pin
(`apps/runtime/src/hermes/engine.ts`), refresh that snapshot in the same
change (see its `SOURCE.md`).

Before shipping a Runtime release that changes engine resolution, the bundled
installer snapshot, or the pin, run the
[cold-start verification](hermes-managed-runtime.md#cold-start-verification) —
the automated lanes do not exercise a real bootstrap install.

## Compatibility Floor Rules

* **Do not raise the floor for desktop-only work.** App version bumps do not
  imply Runtime updates.
* **Raise the floor when the app calls a new Runtime contract.** This includes
  new or changed Runtime API fields, capability ids, websocket events, durable
  records, managed Hermes lifecycle behavior, Runtime CLI behavior, or
  Hermes adapter behavior that the app requires.
* **Keep compatible Runtime fixes optional.** If a Runtime patch improves
  reliability but old app builds keep working, publish the Runtime artifact
  without changing `tavern.runtime.minimumVersion`.
* **Use patch bumps inside a Runtime API epoch.** If Runtime compatibility needs
  a clean break, bump the minor version and raise the app floor to that new
  minor.
* **Verify old Runtime behavior when leaving the floor unchanged.** Run the
  focused app/server test lane against the floor contract or add a fixture-backed
  test for the field/event/capability the app consumes.

Raise `tavern.runtime.minimumVersion` when any answer is yes:

* Does the app require a new Runtime API route, request field, response field, or
  error shape?
* Does the app require a new Runtime capability id, health state, event, durable
  record, job, or storage invariant?
* Does the app require new managed Hermes startup, dashboard/API/Gateway,
  model config, or adapter behavior?
* Does the app require new Runtime CLI, Homebrew service, artifact layout, port,
  or environment behavior?
* Would the new app fail, hide core functionality, corrupt state, or show a
  false healthy state against the current floor Runtime?

Do not raise `tavern.runtime.minimumVersion` when every answer is no. Examples:

* UI copy, layout, navigation, visual polish, or desktop updater changes.
* App cache, optimistic UI, local settings, or presentation-only fixes.
* Runtime fixes that old app builds can use opportunistically but the new app
  does not require.
* Release tooling or documentation changes that do not change the Runtime
  artifact contract.

## User Update Contract

The Tavern updater has one visible product flow:

1. Show the topbar updater control when an app update is available, Runtime must
   be staged, a stage/download/restart is active, or the configured Runtime is
   disconnected.
2. Stage Runtime with `brew update && brew upgrade tavern-runtime`. Do not
   restart Runtime during staging.
3. Download the desktop update.
4. Show **Restart** only when every required artifact is staged.
5. On restart, restart Runtime first, wait for the minimal Runtime health check,
   then restart the desktop app when an app update is staged.

Do not reintroduce a separate Runtime update wizard or fake progress checklist.
Runtime install progress is phase-based unless Runtime owns real byte progress.
Do not use the updater control as a generic failure surface. Runtime connection
failures link to Runtime settings, where the full connection error is shown.

## Homebrew Tap

`zknicker/homebrew-tavern` is first-party Tavern release infrastructure. Treat
it as part of this repository's release surface, not as a separate downstream
project.

When Runtime install, update, service, artifact, environment, port, or CLI
behavior changes:

* update Tavern release scripts in this repository
* update the generated Homebrew formula contract
* update the tap README and any tap-local operator docs
* verify the tap still documents install, update, service control, logs, and
  environment overrides

`release:publish-homebrew-formula` owns the formula write path. It updates
`zknicker/homebrew-tavern` by default through `TAVERN_HOMEBREW_TAP_REPO`, or an
explicit local checkout through `TAVERN_HOMEBREW_TAP_DIR`.

Desktop builds compile `assets/mac-icon.icon` with Xcode `actool` before Electron
packaging. The compiled `Assets.car` provides the layered Liquid Glass app icon
on macOS 26, and `AppIcon.icns` remains the fallback icon for older macOS
versions and Electron's DMG/app bundle path.

Tavern ships two production artifacts:

* `Tavern.app` is the desktop client plus its local app backend.
* `tavern-runtime-<version>-<target>.tar.gz` is the always-on Runtime server for
  a Mac mini or other host.

The desktop app connects to the configured Runtime URL. Runtime deployment and
Homebrew service management live in [Runtime Deployment](runtime-deploy.md).

Keep every published changelog version anchored by a matching `vX.Y.Z` git tag
or a `release: vX.Y.Z` commit. The changelog context command uses that anchor to
collect changes for the next release.

## Environment

Required release environment:

* `TAVERN_RELEASE_BASE_URL`
* `TAVERN_RELEASE_S3_URI`
* `TAVERN_HOMEBREW_TAP_REPO` defaults to `zknicker/homebrew-tavern`
* `TAVERN_HOMEBREW_TAP_DIR` optionally points to a local tap checkout
* `CSC_NAME` or `CSC_LINK` + `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`
* `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`
* `APPLE_PASSWORD` is accepted as a compatibility alias for
  `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

The GitHub Release step uses `gh`; run `gh auth status` before publishing.

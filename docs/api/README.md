# Tavern API

The Tavern API is `@tavern/api`-defined, Runtime-hosted, and SDK-wrapped.

Tavern App, bots, webhooks, automations, managed Hermes, local tools, and
tests use this surface instead of reading app caches, runtime tables, or
Hermes state.

Tavern's shape is clear:

* **`@tavern/api` defines the contract.** OpenAPI owns chat and realtime wire
  shapes; typed runtime contracts own admin and control routes.
* **Runtime serves the contract.** Tavern Runtime owns durable chat state,
  responses, activity, artifacts, event cursors, and automation delivery.
* **The SDK wraps the contract.** `@tavern/sdk` gives TypeScript clients a small
  typed API over Tavern API types.
* **Docs explain behavior.** Markdown covers ownership, ordering, durability,
  recovery, and intentional omissions.

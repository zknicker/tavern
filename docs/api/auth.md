# Auth

Grotto is a local-owner app. The owner controls the App process, Runtime host,
workspace files, and model-provider credentials.

## Trust Boundaries

| Boundary | Trust |
| --- | --- |
| Electron shell and local Node app | One Grotto App product boundary |
| Grotto App to Grotto Runtime | Paired local transport with runtime credentials |
| Runtime to model providers | Provider-specific local OAuth or API-key credentials |
| External client to Tavern API | Explicit Tavern-issued credentials when exposed |
| Agent/tool access to Tavern data | Narrow tool/API capability, not raw database access |

## Secrets

Model provider credentials belong to their provider integration:

- Claude Code sign-in is a Runtime-owned OAuth credential created from
  Model access (code-paste flow) and stored in the runtime vault. When no
  sign-in exists, a detected host Claude Code login is used instead — this
  works on desktop Macs (a GUI session can grant keychain reads) but not on
  headless hosts, where keychain prompts cannot be answered; see
  [specs/model-access.md](../../specs/model-access.md).
  `TAVERN_AGENT_CLAUDE_CODE_AUTH_TOKEN` (`claude setup-token`) remains an
  operator env escape hatch.
- Codex uses vault-backed OAuth credentials refreshed by the Runtime.
- Anthropic, OpenAI, and OpenRouter API-key routes use Runtime-stored
  provider secrets or explicit environment overrides such as
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `TAVERN_AGENT_API_KEY`.
- Plugin credentials live in Plugin-specific secret storage.

Do not put secrets in:

- Chat messages
- response activity metadata
- e2e scripts
- checked-in config
- checked-in env files

Telemetry-only credentials belong to the feature that reads telemetry. For
example, OpenRouter account activity uses a management key stored as Stats
source settings, not as an inference credential.

## Runtime Access

The Runtime HTTP and event websocket APIs accept either the configured Tavern
Runtime token or a verified Clerk session. The Runtime generates its token on
first start and keeps it in its host config file (`<runtime-root>/tavern.json`,
`token` key, mode `0600`). Override with `TAVERN_RUNTIME_TOKEN`. The health route
is unauthenticated.

When the Runtime host is remote, run `grotto token` on the host to display the
pairing token, then save that token in the App settings.

Owners may pair with the Runtime token. Invited members connect with the Runtime
URL only: Grotto App forwards their current Clerk session without persisting the
session token in the connection record. The app refreshes the server's ephemeral
session transport while signed in; reconnecting HTTP clients and event sockets
use the newest session.

Runtime-token and owner sessions have full Runtime access. Member sessions may
use the Tavern `/api/*` chat surface and read app-facing identity, capabilities,
events, agents, models, and Mac app inventory. Runtime administration remains
owner-only, including model access, agent environment, Plugins, MCP, updates,
development routes, Memory settings, and timezone settings. Verified
non-members remain limited to identity introspection and invite redemption.

Clients use Tavern API or TypeScript SDK surfaces instead of reading local
SQLite files, runtime stores, or executor state directly.

## Identity And Sign-In

Normative model: [specs/identity.md](../../specs/identity.md). Summary of the
implemented surface:

- Grotto App requires Clerk sign-in when `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is set
  (dev: `apps/website/.env.local`, pulled with `clerk env pull`). Keyless
  builds run a signed-out dev mode with no gate; e2e forces keyless. If
  clerk-js cannot load (offline), the app renders local data on the cached
  identity instead of locking the user out. Packaged desktop builds use
  Clerk's native header authentication, keep the encrypted client token in
  Electron storage, and complete Google sign-in in the system browser through
  the `grotto://sso-callback` protocol. Existing builds continue to accept the
  legacy `tavern://sso-callback` protocol during the rename.
- Dev builds automatically sign in as the configured dev user when
  `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` and `DEV_CLERK_SIGN_IN_USER_ID` are set in the
  machine-local root `.env`. E2e remains keyless and does not use this flow.
- The app attaches the Clerk session token to server requests
  (`Authorization: Bearer`, websocket `connectionParams.clerkSessionToken`);
  the server exposes it as `ctx.clerkSessionToken`.
- The Runtime verifies forwarded Clerk tokens against the instance JWKS when
  `TAVERN_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (or `clerkPublishableKey` in `tavern.json`)
  is set. Verified users are minted `identity_users` rows keyed by tavern
  user id; the first verified user to connect claims an unclaimed runtime as
  `owner`. Non-members can only introspect `/identity/me` and redeem
  invites. The `identity` capability reports this state.
- The runtime token remains the owner transport credential and bypasses
  membership. `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` is CLI/dev-only and must never ship in
  client code or version control.
- Production runs on the Clerk instance at `clerk.grotto.sh` (Google OAuth
  via the Grotto Clerk client in the technical `tavern-499717` Google Cloud project). Desktop
  release builds bake the pk_live publishable key via the
  `desktop:build:release` script; dev and unsigned builds stay on the dev
  instance. Before release, both Clerk instances must whitelist the canonical
  `grotto://sso-callback` redirect and retain the legacy callback during the
  rename.
